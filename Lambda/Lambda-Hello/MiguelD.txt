My name is (Super Awesome) Miguel Diaz. I am a creative, friendly, and critical thinker. I love to create things and to learn. I self taught myself how to 3D design models. I bought a 3D printer to make them come to life and that is my hobby. Besides that, I love to code, and spending time with the wife, and the two furbabies, Flash and Junior (cats). My favorite animal is the flying turtle, because like them, I try to do the impossible.
